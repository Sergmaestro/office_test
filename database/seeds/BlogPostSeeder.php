                'body' => "<p><strong>Innovation doesn&rsquo;t need a huge space.</strong></p>\n<p>Since the<a href=\"http://www.openbsd.org/hackathons.html\" target=\"_blank\"> first-ever hackathon</a> in June 1999, these high-pressure, intense events have exploded in popularity&mdash;and now they&rsquo;ve been taken online.</p>\n<p>While at first glance, the idea of running a virtual hackathon may seem like a huge headache, taking the event to an online platform can actually give you a diverse and effective boost.</p>\n<p>For one thing, there&rsquo;s no location restraint, which means your online hackathon will attract participants from a greater diversity of profiles. The talent pool is pretty much limitless and as long as you&rsquo;re running your event on a reliable and powerful platform, participants will be able to tune in from wherever they are and build more complex and well-developed ideas together.</p>\n<p>But running a virtual hackathon isn&rsquo;t without its challenges. From messy team formation to miscommunication about project expectations, an event with as many moving parts as a hackathon can quickly become one big chaotic mess.</p>\n<p>With the right tools and predetermined systems in place, you can streamline all the time-consuming admin tasks, while increasing the quality of submissions at the same time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here are six key tips to make your virtual hackathon a success:</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://eventornado-files.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/the-rise-of-online-hackathons-illustration.png\" alt=\"6 key tips for running your next virtual hackathon\">\n</figure>\n<h3>1. Host your online hackathon on a smart and adaptable platform&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Whether it&rsquo;s physical or virtual, hackathons have a ton of moving parts so one of the first things to do is to choose a platform that will streamline as much of it as possible. Stages that can be automated <em>should</em> be automated; reviewers should have an easy way of scoring submissions, and communication should be fluid and easy.</p>\n<p>To make your challenge a success, make sure your chosen platform offers at the very least, all of the following:</p>\n<p><strong>For participants:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submit projects directly within the platform&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Form teams online with clear visibility</li>\n<li>Edit their submission after they have submitted (but before the review begins)</li>\n<li>Move through the multiple submission phases smoothly, working from one smart form</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For organizers:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access all participant&rsquo;s details from within the platform</li>\n<li>View all parts of submitted projects easily without having to download video, photo or PDF attachments</li>\n<li>A simple way to initiate team formation</li>\n<li>Assign submissions to reviewers on a secure, private platform so scores are hidden from other reviewers</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Clearly define the goal of your virtual event&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Running a hackathon online is no easy task, but with the right tools and systems in place, the results can be wildly successful.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One thing you can do right from the start is to be crystal clear on what you want to get out of your event.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Define it clearly. Write it down. Pin it on your computer. Remind your colleagues about it.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Do you want to walk away (virtually) from your hackathon with a marketable viable product? Are you using your virtual event to build a stronger community? Whatever your goals are, define it from the start and let it drive each part of the process.</p>\n<h3>3. Be extra responsive with participants</h3>\n<p>No matter how clearly you communicate, you&rsquo;re bound to come up against a piece of misinformation or lack of clarity, especially if you&rsquo;re handling hundreds and thousands of submissions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For Edgar, one of our founders here at Eventornado, this is where a lot of organizers slip up. &ldquo;For some participants, a hackathon can be a life-changing event&mdash;they take it extremely seriously&rdquo;, he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And it&rsquo;s not just for the winning teams&mdash;many participants build lifelong contacts and relationships from a hackathon and have the chance to showcase their skills.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>That experience can easily be ruined by slow communication or misunderstanding about project expectations.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Edgar advises organizers to be extra responsive with participants and to be patient when answering a question for the second or third time. &ldquo;Lead with empathy&rdquo;, he advises. &ldquo;No matter how clearly you share rules and expectations of the hackathon, there&rsquo;ll always be someone who didn&rsquo;t understand or missed an important point. It&rsquo;s a high-stress environment&mdash;everyone&rsquo;s worried&rdquo;.</p>\n<h3>4. Over-communicate, every step of the way&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>With no physical person there to make announcements, virtual hackathons can get real disorganized, real fast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Online events require more guidelines and clarifications than physical ones, and it&rsquo;s an event organizer&rsquo;s job to make sure everyone&rsquo;s on the same page.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Participants should never be confused about timing or project expectations, and there should always be open lines of communication.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>If teams are running across different time zones, for example, you&rsquo;ll need a platform that works smartly to help them collaborate despite the time differences. If a participant needs clarification on project expectations, make sure there&rsquo;s a function that allows them to contact organizers and other team members easily and quickly.</p>\n<p>When you have something to update or announce, do it promptly and share it with participants as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about being repetitive&mdash;it&rsquo;s always better to over-communicate than to leave messages open for interpretation and potentially harm a participant&rsquo;s chance of success.</p>\n<h3>5. Don&rsquo;t micromanage or over-structure</h3>\n<p>Considering the communication barriers and challenges that come with running a virtual hackathon, you might be tempted to over-structure and over-analyze every detail.</p>\n<p><strong>Resist the urge. While an organizer is responsible for the planning, running, and general smooth going of the event, hackathons are fundamentally driven by participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>One way you can avoid the urge to micromanage is to steer clear of organizing too many compulsory virtual information sessions or progress updates. Give participants all the information they need around timeframes and expectations, but make sure you&rsquo;re not telling teams how to use their time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Keep communication open and clear, but don&rsquo;t force participants to tune in to every small update while they could be hacking.</strong></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also a good idea to give participants a small nudge to try and submit their idea ahead of time. There&rsquo;s so much that can delay submission&mdash;trouble with video upload or oversized attachments&mdash;and it can all jeopardize the quality of the final idea.</p>\n<p>By giving participants plenty of time to form and solidify their ideas while working harmoniously within their teams, you can help ensure no one is scrambling at the last minute.</p>\n<p>Edgar leaves us with one final piece of advice and that&rsquo;s not to over-worry during those last moments. &ldquo;Make sure you take the time to prepare and clear your schedule completely during the last few days of the hackathon&rdquo;, he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Those last few days or hours are the peak phase of the event&mdash;carve out the time to deal with any last-minute hiccups and keep a cool head,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<h3>6. Streamline the team formation process</h3>\n<p>When it comes to virtual events, efficiency isn&rsquo;t a nice to have, but a must.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During in-person hackathons, participant matchmaking can be a huge challenge, for both participants and the organizers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Without guidance, the early stages of building an idea and forming teams can be extremely chaotic and dizzying, with lots of miscommunication and a lack of productivity.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Hundreds of people from different backgrounds come together and need to form teams fast. They then have to figure out how to work together seamlessly and coherently&mdash;not an easy task.</p>\n<p>When you host your hackathon online, you can minimize the disorientation and stress by streamlining the entire matchmaking process. Rather than spending a full day on team formation, you can let participants form their teams from within the platform, regardless of where they&rsquo;re tuning in from.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Running a successful virtual hackathon with Eventornado</h2>\n<p>While collecting and reviewing submissions is a relatively straightforward task (if you only need to deal with a handful of applications), the more submissions your event receives, the more chaotic your job gets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With a smart <a href=\"https://eventornado.com/\" target=\"_blank\">events management platform</a>, you can take the chaos out of running your next hackathon and focus on the bigger picture. Everything you need lives in the same place (no need for any more clunky spreadsheets) and communication is made to be swift, clear, and fast.</p>\n<p><a href=\"{{ route(\'request-demo\') }}\">Request a free demo of Eventornado</a> and learn how you can eliminate the tedious admin tasks while giving your participants the best possible experience.

Yes, you!</p>\n<h2>7 reasons why your company should run a hackathon&nbsp;</h2>\n<h3>1.&nbsp;Hackathons are a natural way to drive innovation&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Did you know that <a href=\"https://www.hackerearth.com/community-hackathons/resources/e-books/guide-to-organize-hackathon/\">over 80% of Fortune 100 companies run hackathons</a> to drive innovation? More than 50% of them are recurring events.</p>\n<p><strong>When you run a hackathon, you&rsquo;re doing more than simply running an event. You&rsquo;re giving your company the best possible opportunity to innovate.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Think of how fast ideas and decisions get made during a three-day hackathon. Teams meet (virtually) on a Friday and potentially have a viable product on Sunday. It&rsquo;s practically, if not completely, impossible to match that level of risk-taking and solution-based thinking on a day-to-day basis.</p>\n<p>Hosting a hackathon is a tangible way to explore what your community has to offer. You learn about industry developments while generating fresh ideas from the brightest talent. If that&rsquo;s not reason enough, keep reading.</p>\n<h3>2.&nbsp;Get people talking about your company</h3>\n<p>Hackathons are incredibly fast-paced, hectic, and high energy&mdash;and it&rsquo;s a perfect opportunity to get people talking about your company.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a physical event (we&rsquo;ll wait a bit longer for that) or virtual, a hackathon brings people together to work on projects and create innovative solutions <em>under your company&rsquo;s branding.</em></p>\n<p><strong>When you decide to run a hackathon, you&rsquo;re letting potential talent know that you value innovation and think outside the box.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>By building that community of teams within such a short space of time, you can strengthen your company&rsquo;s presence in the industry and connect your name to innovation within a matter of days.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>3.&nbsp;You can attract powerful PR. For free.</h3>\n<p>One of the most underrated things that happen to companies that run a hackathon?</p>\n<p>Free PR.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Put yourself in the media&rsquo;s shoes for a second. There are 50 app development companies in the area, and four of them run hackathons on a regular basis. How would those four companies look to you, compared to the other 46?</p>\n<p>Digitally-savvy. Progressive. Young. Innovative.</p>\n<p>Showing the world that you go out of your way to give employees and your extended community a real opportunity to express themselves, think outside the box, and create real solutions, is a pretty hot look.</p>\n<h3>4.&nbsp;Attract the best candidates in the field</h3>\n<p>Poor hiring decisions <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2007/03/maximizing-your-return-on-people\">count for 80% of employee turnover</a>, according to the Harvard Review. It&rsquo;s not difficult to see why&mdash;we know job interviews aren&rsquo;t the most productive way to gauge a candidate&rsquo;s ability and it definitely doesn&rsquo;t give a full 360-degree view of a person&rsquo;s skill set.</p>\n<p><strong>But say you&rsquo;re looking for a young and talented coding whizz? There&rsquo;s no better place to find her than a hackathon.</strong></p>\n<p>Hackathons are focused on doing, not talking. It means you can instantly see how people deal with fast-paced environments, and what they&rsquo;re capable of under pressure and working within a team.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And whether it&rsquo;s a physical or virtual event, hackathons are made up of people who want to showcase their skills and find new career opportunities. Some of them may be actively seeking to establish new professional relationships.</p>\n<p>Rather than conducting interview after interview, you can find skilled minds in a talent-rich environment. Watch them in action, reach out to them, and start a new working relationship.</p>\n<h3>5.&nbsp;Break up the monotony and boost company morale</h3>\n<p>A hackathon forces participants to work frantically (and often around the clock) on a single project, for a short period of time. Then, it&rsquo;s time to forget about it and move on completely.</p>\n<p>For engineers, coders, and software developers, in particular, that intensity is a welcomed break from the monotony of working on the same products day in day out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Working for a few hours in teams without meetings or phone calls, towards a common goal can help lift employees out of their normal roles and take a mental break from their usual routine.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>When you run a hackathon, you encourage collaboration and creativity in a setting built for team building and positive competition.</strong></p>\n<p>And it&rsquo;s also fun! Hackathons are great fun for participants involved, and the high adrenaline, competitive energy, and ticking clock just make it that much more exciting to look forward to. And even outside engineering and software, the complete change of pace is a great way to boost team spirit if you decide to run an internal hackathon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And of course, there&rsquo;s the prize at the end!</p>\n<h3>6. Produce long-lasting ideas and products</h3>\n<p>One of the most important reasons why you might want to run a hackathon! By the end of your fast-paced event, there&rsquo;s a high chance the winning teams(s) will have created a minimum viable product. At the very least, you&rsquo;ll have fresh new ideas and features you can take away and get to work on.</p>\n<p>Facebook&rsquo;s &lsquo;Like&rsquo; button and Microsoft&rsquo;s GroupMe messaging app, for instance, were both born from hackathons.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s not to say the motivation behind a hackathon is to get free prototypes out of talented techies. You&rsquo;ll probably use your company&rsquo;s infrastructure to encourage specific projects, but it&rsquo;s important to give all participants the creative freedom to build out their own idea.</p>\n<h3>7. Give back to society</h3>\n<p>The business appeals of running a hackathon are plenty, but hackathons are widely used to help the greater good too. From battling homelessness to saving the planet, there are lots of initiatives working to solve both local and larger social issues.</p>\n<p>Capsule, for example, ran a two-day virtual hackathon, <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5de1595ff5155d068a3bb52b/t/5efcc6d0603e98547503c221/1593624308924/CAPSULE_Impact_Report_June_2020+%281%29.pdf\">Capsule Hack</a>, to find solutions for the current global warming crisis. Rocket Software matches university students with professional engineers to <a href=\"https://www.rocketsoftware.com/\">solve local social issues</a> like homelessness in the San Jose area.</p>\n<p>Not only can you work to make your environment a better place, but you&rsquo;re also nurturing young minds to make a real difference with solutions-based thinking. That&rsquo;s a win-win.</p>\n<h2>Are you ready to launch your first hackathon?</h2>\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re in the business of software, have a problem to solve, or you want to test, hack, or build a new product, a hackathon will help you get there.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We live in an explosive digital era, and technical innovation isn&rsquo;t just a nice to have anymore, it&rsquo;s a must. Businesses that want to stay ahead of their competition are quickly learning that running a hackathon is one of the most effective ways to remain relevant, grow with innovation, and enjoy exposure to the brightest minds in the field.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been musing with the idea of running your own hackathon, we would love to chat. We&rsquo;ll get you sorted with a free demo of our platform so you can lead with your best foot forward.</p>\n<p>And if you&rsquo;re not quite ready to host your own event but you&rsquo;re curious to know how it helps many other businesses just like yours, stay tuned.

When looking for teammates, make it a point to seek out people who are different from you. You want your team to be made up of unique strength and ability, and that only comes from diversity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can look for diversity in domains, like business management, frontend development, UX design, or you can focus on diversity in demographics, gender, race, background, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When it comes to domain diversity, having a well-rounded team can be an invaluable help, right from the ideation phase all the way to execution.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Most hackathon teams are usually made up of three to six people and a strong team typically has members with complementary skill sets&mdash;a project manager, a few coders, someone to focus on design, etc, etc.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Having a group of five data scientists and one coder isn&rsquo;t likely to succeed, just as a group of business analysts won&rsquo;t be able to build a viable product in the end.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whatever diversity means to you, having a team with different skillsets and background will help you supercharge in building a viable product at the end of the hackathon.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Assign roles based on core strengths</h3>\n\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve got your team together, it&rsquo;s absolutely crucial you understand everyone&rsquo;s strengths and approaches. In most cases, there are a few <a href=\"https://entrepreneurquarterly.com/5-roles-every-hackathon-team-needs/\" target=\"_blank\">roles that every hackathon team needs</a>, and you can save heaps of time by assigning those based on everyone&rsquo;s core strengths.</p>\n<p>By assigning tasks in this way, each team member has the chance to work on specific things that they&rsquo;re especially good at.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Prepare for this as much as you can&mdash;if you have enough time, try a preparation exercise where you come up with a mock idea and get the team organised into tasks and roles and see how you work as a team. The more prepared you are for this, the higher your chance of succeeding at the end!</p>\n\n<h3>4. Find people you gel with&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>This may well be the most important tip of all. While having a solid team dynamic is fundamental in any context, hackathons come with a level of pressure, stress and exhaustion that can only feel worse if you&rsquo;re stuck with a team that you don&rsquo;t quite click with.</p>\n<p>Find people you think you&rsquo;ll be able to work well with and make sure everyone is bringing some level of value to the table.</p>\n\n<h3>5. Find the message behind the hackathon</h3>\n\n<p>You can set your team apart by miles with this short exercise. It&rsquo;s also a useful way to gauge each members ability to dig deep and think outside the box.</p>\n<p>During the ideation phase, get together and brainstorm the message behind the hackathon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>What are the companies looking for? What do they really want? Who are the event sponsors? How are they connected to the company running the hackathon?</em></p>\n<p>A hackathon organised by Apple, for example, is probably looking for final ideas that will utilise the iOS system, even if down the line. Get your team in the right state of mind before the hackathon even begins, or use this as an exercise to find your best members.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Put your best foot forward with Eventornado</h2>\n<p>Aside from the fun and camaraderie involved that draws so many programmers and innovators to hackathons all year-long, you also need to develop real solutions that solve real problems.</p>\n<p>To do that, you need a fantastic team.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One way Eventornado makes life easier for hackathon organisers and participants is in the way teams are formed. Before our customers starting using Eventornado, team formation was a little messy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Without a centralised place to communicate, participants would usually submit their ideas on some type of survey form. Then, they would get invited to a Slack workspace with other participants, and pitch their idea in a huge channel, pitting against hundreds of other participants promoting their own ideas.</strong></p>\n<p>With Eventornado, it&rsquo;s easy to reach out to others and start the initial team-building process once you&rsquo;re in the platform. You can find people based on criteria like skillset or experience level, start the conversation, and quickly figure out if you&rsquo;re a good match.</p>\n<p><br/>A great team can adapt to any situation, and it&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important to make sure yours is a winning one.

While I&rsquo;ve been at it for eight years, Martin has been building technical solutions for well over 15 years. The most notable of them is Pipedrive, a CRM tool that is used by over 90 000 organizations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now in 2020, we joined forces to create Eventornado &mdash; a tool that helps you to organize online and offline hackathons. What is there to build for organizing hackathons, you might be thinking? Well, as it turns out&hellip; a lot:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating a landing page for your event</li>\n<li>Processing registrations and ideas</li>\n<li>Team formation</li>\n<li>Evaluation</li>\n<li>Communication</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All in one place.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a tough business, since hackathons are being organized 24/7, and due to its nature of being a stressful endeavor, you need to be there for your customers all day, every day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So why are we doing it? First, did I mention we love to build useful solutions? Second, there are a lot of exciting things that keep coming our way.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A lot has already happened during these four months. It felt like a good time to reflect on the different facets of this experience.</p>\n<h3><strong>The exciting&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p>Needless to say, building Eventornado has been extremely fun for us. Mostly because there&rsquo;s a pressing need for such a solution and we&rsquo;re blessed with having customers that use the tool every day, giving us a ton of feedback that we can execute on.</p>\n<p>However, there are some specific parts we are especially excited about:&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong>1. Fantastic teamwork</strong></h4>\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that we&rsquo;re a fully remote team. We&rsquo;re based in Estonia, Portugal, Ukraine, and Italy. We intend to stay remote even after the current healthcare crisis resolves.</p>\n<p>We managed to build our team such that everyone is independent. There&rsquo;s no small talk, no procrastinating, and no vast amounts of table tennis, game consoles or other modern office distractions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We try to be as efficient as possible. Everyone has a Trello board where tasks get crunched every day, without any mercy. We as the founders have a catch-up call once a week, and that&rsquo;s more than enough for us to keep on building.</p>\n<p>So far it has turned out exceptionally well for us. Although there is no ping pong playing, we&rsquo;re having the time of our lives working efficiently as a team.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4><strong>2. We&rsquo;re proud of what we built</strong></h4>\n<p>You can&rsquo;t build a long-lasting software if you&rsquo;re not genuinely excited about what you&rsquo;re building. We have a lot of features, from processing participants to team formation, all the way to evaluation. However, our <strong>integrated chat system</strong> is probably something we&rsquo;re the proudest of.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you were running a hackathon before Eventornado, you&rsquo;d have to set up a separate Slack workspace for your participants. Slack is a fantastic tool, but for hackathons, it creates a lot of friction for the organizers and participants:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The organizers have to set up and configure their Slack workspace manually with each hackathon.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>After your participants have signed up for your event, they also have to sign up to your Slack workspace by creating an account and filling out their profile.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>You have to write 1&ndash;2 page guidelines for your participants on which channels to join and how to create a private group for your teams.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For us, this was hands down one of the most fascinating challenges to solve so far.</p>\n<p>Our solution &mdash; an integrated channel-based chat system which works similarly as Slack does, is built with the following improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatic chat setup - it&rsquo;s all taken care of for the organizer.</li>\n<li>The chat is fully integrated into the hackathon website - no separate signup is necessary for the participants.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>User profiles automatically filled from the registration data.</li>\n<li>Users auto-assigned to relevant channels (including their team channels)</li>\n<li>Video calls</li>\n<li>A function to post your idea&nbsp;</li>\n<li>and much more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We put a ton of development effort into this and luckily after we launched this, it quickly became one of the most used functionalities of Eventornado.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4><strong>3. The geographical distribution of our customers</strong></h4>\n<p>Within just four months, we&rsquo;ve been able to work with many wonderful customers from all over the world.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s such a joy to serve hackathon organizers from the UK, Estonia, Sweden, Latvia, the African continent, the US, Oman, India, New Zealand, and more.</p>\n<p>Building a product is always exciting. But the excitement is only fully realized when you have people actually using it. Our customers are the ones who give us the energy and inspiration to keep on building.</p>\n<h3><strong>The challenging</strong></h3>\n<p>Of course, there have been a ton of mistakes along the way. The prevailing startup advice is to focus on a super narrow segment and solve that extremely well. It&rsquo;s great advice, but we also knew that when it comes to hackathons, a lot of issues arise from trying to combine too many tools to get the job done.</p>\n<p>We decided to come out with the full suite of tools that cover the entire event from registration all the way to awarding winners in the end. We accomplished this goal, but of course many parts were far from polished enough by the time we launched.</p>\n<p>We also initially designed the tool to be way too rigid. We didn&rsquo;t consider the fluid nature of these events where things are in constant development.</p>\n<p>These initial decisions and mistakes meant the first few events we ran were a bit of a painful experience both for us and the customers.</p>\n<p>The silver lining is we learned a lot from these issues. We&rsquo;ve rebuilt and polished big parts of the platform over the past two months. We&rsquo;re sorry for the early hiccups but no amount of research could have given us the clarity that these early users did.</p>\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"https://eventornado-files.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/our-first-4-months-with-eventornado-tweet.png\" alt=\"Tweet\">\n    </figure>\n<h3><strong>The unknowns</strong></h3>\n<p>Fortunately, we don&rsquo;t have a lot of time to ponder too much about the unknowns. However, these are some of the questions that cross our minds from time to time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How are we able to keep our team small and agile, even if we grow 50x from here?</li>\n<li>What can we do to bring hackathons to every company, and grow this market 100 times?&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Should we take on other verticals as well in the medium term or keep our focus 100% on hackathons?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>So, what&rsquo;s next?</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Make the platform easier to use for the organizers&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Make some of our core functionalities stronger&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Explore a specific idea that would potentially help us grow the hackathon market drastically by increasing the quality of hackathon outcomes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re one of the brave ones who reached the end of this blog post, thank you! We&rsquo;re happy to see people interested in our journey and we&rsquo;ll do our best to continue sharing our experience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say for sure if we&rsquo;ll reach the moon, but I sure am certain we&rsquo;ll have a ton of fun trying.</p>"

For a country of only 1.3 million people it&rsquo;s quite an achievement. As one of the founders of Pipedrive I might have some insight into why that is. Hackathons had a huge part in the early stages of Pipedrive. Which definitely influenced me when deciding to co-found an online hackathon platform next.&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>The Skype effect</h1>\n<p>Much has been written about it already and it&rsquo;s hard to underestimate the impact Skype has had on Estonia over the years. While the effects are many, the main two things I&rsquo;d point out is <strong>belief</strong> and <strong>experience</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As a business-savvy tech person in Europe it&rsquo;s pretty easy to decide that the true unicorns are only built somewhere else. Startup blogs are heavily skewed towards covering Silicon Valley and the US in general. But if a small company next door suddenly gets hundreds of millions of users all over the world and is subsequently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/12/skype-sells-to-ebay-for-41-billion/\" target=\"_blank\">sold for billions of dollars</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/10/microsoft-acquires-skype/\" target=\"_blank\">multiple times</a>, it really shifts one&rsquo;s world view.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure a lot of people in Estonia got the message &ldquo;if these guys can do it, so can I&rdquo;. And while there was a lot of entrepreneurial spirit in the country already before Skype, it probably shifted the ambition levels several orders of magnitude higher than before.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The other part was experience. Hundreds of people that worked at Skype at one time or another got direct access to world class operations and carried it with them to their next destination. We certainly benefited tremendously from a large number of ex-skypers on all levels of the organization at Pipedrive. They brought the skills and knowledge of human resources, engineering and management in general.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We also need to acknowledge the foresight of the Estonian government in the 90s that decided fiber was more important than highways and got the whole country covered with high bandwidth Internet early on. And even though our current government is busy destroying much of the good stuff created in the last 30 years there is some inertia left from the great decisions in these early days. Skype simply couldn&rsquo;t have been built in Estonia without the amazing pool of talent available. And I doubt Transferwise, Bolt or Pipedrive would exist in their current form without it.&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Hackathons energize and accelerate</h1>\n<p>Hackathons are amazing. You put a group of talented eager people together for two days and the results can be mind blowing. Constraints foster creativity and nothing is more constraining than being short on time. Only having a number of hours to complete a prototype really pushes you to find creative shortcuts, cut unnecessary features and forget about procrastination.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned before, hackathons were transformative in the early days of Pipedrive. We would regularly gather for these intense weekend getaways to Peep&rsquo;s summer house in the middle of a forest in Western Estonia. And we would work ourselves to the bone. Some planned out pricing and business strategy, others coded new features non-stop.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One of the best memories I have from these early days is one night at around 4am when we were still up with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/martintajur/\" target=\"_blank\">Martin Tajur</a> coding side by side and listening to Kings of Leon. He was creating a new features page for our marketing website. I was building the first super simple statistics page in the Pipedrive web app.</p>\n\n<p>Neither of these things no longer exists of course. Big teams were put together over the years that have properly rebuilt pretty much everything we made during these intense weekends. And for good reason. The constraints lead to a lot of corner cutting and heavy technical debt.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There is still something magical about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/timorein\" target=\"_blank\">Timo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/urmaspurde/\" target=\"_blank\">Urmas</a> drawing a picture on a whiteboard one morning and having this functionality live the next morning. It takes more time to find a mutually convenient meeting time and have the first discussion in a 600 person company than it used to take to build the entire thing in a 6 person company. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ragnarsass/\" target=\"_blank\">Ragnar</a> got such a jolt from these early hackathons that he co-founded <a href=\"https://garage48.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Garage48</a> on the side which has organized hundreds of hackathons since then.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So whether you want to jumpstart your new company or re-energize innovation in a larger company, organizing hackathons can be a good option. Building prototypes in a couple of days and validating them on real users is invaluable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s to hoping that the current unicorns will spawn at least 4 world class companies each in the next decade. There are already some notable ones. Veriff grew out of Transferwise. And there seems to be at least 7 startups that have been founded by ex-Pipedrivers. Out of which Klaus and Outfunnel have already taken long strides towards success.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If building the next great success story sounds exciting, maybe it&rsquo;s a good time to pick a hackathon from our <a href=\"/events\">Events page</a> and roll up your sleeves.&nbsp;</p>"

                'body' => "<p>The power of the hackathon begins way before launch day.</p>\n<p>You might not think so, but you can affect a candidate&rsquo;s chance of success in lots of ways, and it all starts from your first call to submissions.</p>\n<p>Think of all the touchpoints in the hackathon journey, and what candidates are required to do to go on to the next phase.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>First, there&rsquo;s the call to submissions itself. Then, the registration form (and its inclusivity).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once the participants sign up, ease of communication can make a significant difference in how well they can prepare themselves, build teams, and interact with mentors.</p>\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s the build-up leading to the event, the scoring and review process, all the way to the final winner announcements.</p>\n<p>Each of these stages provides opportunities for hackathon organisers to set participants up for success. Let&rsquo;s look at how.</p>\n<h2>5 ways to set participants up for success right from the start</h2>\n<h3>1. Think deeply about your target audience&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>The people you&rsquo;re hoping to attract should lead every aspect of your hackathon. That means from the call to submission all the way to the scoring process, it&rsquo;s important you keep their strengths and weaknesses at the forefront of your planning process.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re hoping to attract graduate developers and designers to your next hackathon. That demographic will inform many choices you&rsquo;ll make, right down to the tone and language of your registration forms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And it will differ if you&rsquo;re trying to attract industry-leading peers.</p>\n<p><strong>Keep your target audience in mind during every phase of organising your hackathon so you can serve them as best you can, tailor your messaging toward them and ultimately, aid them in their success.</strong></p>\n<h3>2. Recruit multi-disciplinary mentors</h3>\n<p>Mentors play an incredibly vital role in a hackathon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Find and recruit top-quality, multi-disciplinary mentors who can help the participants solve issues in the most productive ways.</p>\n<p>Usually, each mentor will be available for multiple teams and will hear a huge variety of ideas.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On Eventornado, participants can &ldquo;drop&rdquo; mentors into team chats. When mentors are active and lively in the channels, the enthusiasm spreads onto the participants and chat workspaces start booming. It&rsquo;s a great way to keep everyone engaged as they bounce ideas off each other in a fast-paced and friendly space.</p>\n<p><strong>That means a great mentor is one that has an open mind, challenges teams to think innovatively and bring out the best in them, and is able to do so with a calm and encouraging approach.</strong></p>\n<p>Some teams will come up with a winning idea early on, whereas others might not get there as fast, or may fixate on less-important aspects of the project for longer than necessary.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s the mentor&rsquo;s job to help teams keep a steady head, and help move ideas along.</p>\n<h3>3.Allow participants to edit their idea before the final submission</h3>\n<p>Go back to your registration process and consider how you can help participants put their best foot forward before the hackathon has even begun.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When registration opens and participants submit their ideas, you can give them the opportunity to fine-tune and edit their submissions before the final closing date.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On Eventornado, organisers can keep participants engaged throughout the application by asking for more information or additions to the submissions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>This way, participants don&rsquo;t need to submit new forms or ideas, and instead can simply add to their submission as and when they please&mdash;or if the organiser requests more information.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no need to enter their details again or create new applications, which lets the application grow over a period of time.</p>\n<p>One of our founders here at Eventornado, Martin Henk knows how important it is to keep application forms short, sweet and to the point to keep participants engaged and excited.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;By allowing the form to grow over time, we can keep the initial form shorter and less intimidating&rdquo;, he explains. &ldquo;Organisers can ask a few questions in the beginning, and then open up new fields later on in the process&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Martin explains that there are a few questions that wouldn&rsquo;t even make sense if hackathon organisers asked them too early in the application.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He breaks it down for us: &ldquo;Asking for a solution video, or a presentation, for example, just wouldn&rsquo;t make sense at the beginning because the participants won&rsquo;t have those before the hack&mdash;all they might have is a vague idea&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s why within the platform, participants can come in and out of their application at certain points and gradually add to their submissions. Everything stays neat and tidy, collected in the same centralised place.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>4. Give participants a seamless way to communicate with each other</h3>\n<p>Depending on how participants for your hackathon submit ideas and form teams, it&rsquo;s important to have open lines of communication every step of the way.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Before our customers created and organised their hackathons on the Eventornado platform, most of them used Slack.</p>\n<p>While Slack is a great tool for collaborative working (especially for remote workers), not every collaboration is made equal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Hundreds (or sometimes thousands) or people messaging on various Slack channels with their submission ideas, questions or queries can get real messy, real fast.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Participants must create a new account for every hackathon workspace and fill out a new profile each time they sign up to a hackathon. It&rsquo;s also down to the organisers to manually set up both the workspace and all the channels&mdash;which the participants then need to search for in order to create a chat for their team.</p>\n<p>On Eventornado, participants are instantly added into the chat channels as soon as they sign up to the hackathon. What&rsquo;s more, their chat profile is automatically filled out for them based on the details they submitted in their registration form. It&rsquo;s faster, more convenient, and entrants don&rsquo;t need to fiddle around a workspace trying to find the right channel to enter.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of messaging, a lot of spam, and a ton of confusion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Communication is one of the most important aspects of a hackathon.</strong></p>\n<p>Martin explains how: &ldquo;The buzzing energy and exhilarating chaos we all associate with hackathons is actually really hard to replicate.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Beyond the chaos, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s all kinds of interesting people, crazy ideas and chance encounters&mdash;and it can be electrifying if it gets going, but it&rsquo;s a lot harder to achieve that in an online event&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve taken communication seriously within the platform. Though we can&rsquo;t fully replace that community-centred energy people expect from a hackathon, we can certainly provide the best tools and encourage that irreplaceable human connection through active chats and video sessions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For us, it&rsquo;s all about making it as easy as possible for participants to join the conversation&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s with each other, the organisers and mentors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>On Eventornado, participants can share their ideas with one another when they&rsquo;re still in the planning phase. That open communication makes it easy to bounce off each other&rsquo;s creativity, have fun with like-minded people and discuss things they care about.</strong></p>\n<p>But as easy as it is to find chance encounters and meet other entrepreneurs in a fun and active way, communication on Eventornado isn&rsquo;t just about mingling.</p>\n<p>The free-flowing nature of the active chats mean it&rsquo;s ridiculously easy for participants to reach out to organisers and mentors as and when they need to, and it&rsquo;s just as easy for organisers to request feedback on how they could do better.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Organisers can quickly answer any pressing questions and it\'s all from within the same space. There&rsquo;s no need for anyone to download a chat platform or sign up to other services&mdash;every single tool you need for fast, seamless communication, neat and available in one easy-to-use platform.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The platform streamlines the entire chat workspace area&mdash;profiles are pre-filled based on their registration info, and participants are automatically added to their relevant channels.</p>\n<h3>5. Use a high-powered events management platform to score and select winners</h3>\n<p>There are several ways hackathon organiser score, judge and select winners&mdash;some build criteria based on specific metrics and others ask teams to present their demos to their peers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whatever method you use for selecting winners, it&rsquo;s crucial you do so in a way that is fair and gives every participant their best chance. One way to do that?&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>By having a smarter review process that protects the participants and prevents reviews from influencing other scores.</strong></p>\n<p>On a <a href=\"https://eventornado.com/about\">high-powered events management platform like Eventornado</a>, reviewers are assigned groups of ideas to evaluate in just a few clicks. There&rsquo;s no need for giant spreadsheets with 15 admins accessing it all at the same time. There&rsquo;s no table of scores visible to everyone or comments left for the next reviewer to see.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The best thing about it is how easy it is for evaluators. <strong>Most of the time, reviewers are volunteers who have put time aside from their busy lives to review submissions for free.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>When submissions are ready, evaluators simply receive an email that clearly shows which projects they need to review. There&rsquo;s no need to log in or enter any details as the platform automatically authenticates them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rather than figuring out how to access a page, or create an account, they can start reviewing in seconds.</p>\n<p>Every idea is assigned to a reviewer to evaluate, score and submit back into the platform for the organiser to collect.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Give participants their best chance with Eventornado</h2>\n<p><em>If you look at history, innovation does not come just from giving people incentives; it comes from creating environments where their ideas can connect - </em>American author, Steven Johnson</p>\n<p>A great experience for participants means a great hackathon, and we&rsquo;ve built that into the entire process within the Eventornado platform.&nbsp;<br />Do you have a hackathon coming up? <a href=\"{{ route(\'request-demo\') }}\" >Request a free demo of the platform</a> or schedule a chat with us to learn more about how you can streamline your event and give participants the best chance of success right from the start.</p>"

                'body' => "<p>Believe it or not, there&rsquo;s a method to the madness.</p>\n<p>When it comes to selecting winners, some traditional hackathons choose to stick to good old fashioned demos. That&rsquo;s when teams are invited to stand up and demonstrate their project for their peers, mentors and judges.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For smaller hackathons (like an internal company event), that&rsquo;s easy enough.</p>\n<p>But for larger hackathons with hundreds or even thousands of participants, without using a dedicated platform to manage it all? Yikes.</p>\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;Science Fair&rdquo; style of judging, where teams set up tables and judges roam around the room and eventually choose a handful of the top contenders to present a demo.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s safe to say that social distancing has pretty much ruled that one out.</p>\n<p>But what are the best, most dynamic ways to judge a hackathon? Is there a secret formula for creating the perfect criteria? We&rsquo;ve put together fool-proof criteria you can use to judge and pick your next hackathon&rsquo;s top winners:</p>\n<h3>1. Does this have business value?</h3>\n<p>First things first. Will this thing sell?</p>\n<p>While not all hackathons require a viable product or feature, tool, etc., the winning team&rsquo;s idea needs to contribute to something. If it&rsquo;s not a solution to the problem, it needs to be a means to eventually getting there.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Examine and evaluate the teams and map it against the market. Is this idea going to make money, or at least contribute to the solution that will?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Is there a potential to grow the idea into something profitable?</p>\n<h3>2. Will it make an impact?</h3>\n<p>A copycat idea doesn&rsquo;t impress anyone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the most key criteria when judging a hackathon comes down to how original the idea is. It doesn&rsquo;t need to be the next Microsoft, but it should certainly be impressing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A great hackathon idea should wow both the judges <em>and</em> other hackers, and while it may be unrealistic to strictly expect a brand new, never-heard-before masterpiece idea (although that happens), you should at least be seeing a fresh approach to an old problem. <strong>That can be just as impressive as a completely novel idea.</strong></p>\n<p>So, how much edge does the idea have? Is it original and cleverly thought out?</p>\n<h3>3. Is it realistic?</h3>\n<p>A team&rsquo;s product can be cool and original enough to completely knock your socks off, <em>but is it realistic?</em></p>\n<p>Judging an idea against how realistic it is to execute is often where some judges trip up&mdash;after all, a hackathon is a crazy hectic event where some of the digital world&rsquo;s most whacky ideas get cooked up. Shouldn&rsquo;t a little bit of crazy be okay?</p>\n<p>In theory, yes. Some of the most exciting hacks have been utterly useless in terms of producing minimum viable products&mdash;BUT they&rsquo;ve gone down in digital history as making a mark on the hackathon world.</p>\n<p>So it depends entirely on what you want from your hackathon. <strong>If you&rsquo;re looking for original viable products with potential for market value, judge against how realistic the idea is.</strong></p>\n<h3>4. Have the team innovated to build this product?</h3>\n<p>Judges, this is what you want.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While an idea may be original and/or impressive, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean it&rsquo;s an innovative one.</p>\n<p><strong>Did the team factor in all their disposable resources and time in order to come up with the final product? How strong is their awareness of how others are attempting to solve the same problem?</strong></p>\n<p>Could this product be used as a stepping stone for even better products? Is it a real solution to a problem? Has it confronted a new problem? Does the final product have a sustainable lifecycle? Are there opportunities for collaboration?</p>\n<h2>Choosing hackathon winners with fool-proof criteria</h2>\n<p>Judging a hackathon can be incredibly exciting&mdash;and high-pressured and difficult at the same time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Without clear criteria to judge teams on, judges are left to evaluate ideas based on initial redactions, external opinions and other non-reliable factors, potentially passing up on great talent.</p>\n<p>Choosing the &ldquo;best project&rdquo; comes with a lot of pressure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With these four criteria, judges can focus on each area separately to more accurately evaluate the strongest ideas and eventually choose a winner. And as well as helping organisers find their winners, having clear criteria is vital for fair reviewing.</p>\n<p>With a crystal clear set of criteria for all judges to follow, organisers can rest easy knowing that judges are evaluating their assigned teams with the same pre-approved requirements. And with Eventornado, organisers can add as many evaluation criteria as they need.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br /><em>Do you have your own set of criteria you use for judging hackathon teams? </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/eventornado/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Send us a message on LinkedIn</em></a><em>&mdash;we&rsquo;d love to know!</em></p>"

The truth is, creating the hackathon and sharing the hackathon is only half the battle. You need to get people to attend, and you need to attract the <em>right people.</em></p>\n<p>So, where do lots of hackathon organisers slip up during the process? Why do some hackathons attract the brightest minds, while others barely fill a (virtual) room?</p>\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s all in the application process.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Typically, hackathon registration will have two types of forms:</p>\n<p><strong>General registration</strong> - where you might ask personal identifying information.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea form</strong> - where you&rsquo;ll ask questions about participants&rsquo; ideas.</p>\n<p>Some hackathon organisers choose to only use ideas forms&mdash;in this post, we&rsquo;re covering both general registration forms and idea forms.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve rounded up some of the reasons why a hackathon&rsquo;s submission process falls short and struggles to get people registering. Let&rsquo;s dive in.</p>\n<h2>7 reasons why you&rsquo;re not attracting winning applicants</h2>\n<h3>1. Your application form is too long</h3>\n<p>Lengthy forms that ask for too much information is an excellent way to cause an eye roll and a swift exit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For every question you include, ask yourself why you need that answer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s worth noting that not all participants register with an idea. Many want to join an existing team, network, share ideas etc. So important to keep the registration form as concise as possible to encourage more signups.</strong></p>\n<p>Keep your application forms as short as possible, without sacrificing vital details. Your future applicants will thank you for it!</p>\n<h3>2. Your forms are not inclusive</h3>\n<p>While it may seem common to ask applicants for their gender, it may not necessarily be useful or relevant to include it in your forms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More organisations are aiming to be more inclusive with their chosen wording. For example, asking the question &ldquo;what is your gender&rdquo; with only <em>male</em> and <em>female</em> as the two possible options, may alienate some applicants and cause frustration.</p>\n<p>Unless you require information about gender demographics for inclusive purposes, consider if you even need to ask this question at all. Remember, only ask the questions that you need in order to host a great hackathon.</p>\n<p>But if you really need to, <a href=\"https://www.ruth-ng.co.uk/how-to-ask-about-gender-in-forms-respectfully/\" target=\"_blank\">here&rsquo;s a detailed guide</a> on how you can ask for gender in a thoughtful and more respectful way on application forms.</p>\n<h3>3. Your form is clunky or slow</h3>\n<p>Is there anything more frustrating than a clunky interface and a page that refuses to load? We&rsquo;ll wager on no.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your application form is the first point of contact most applicants will have with you so it&rsquo;s important you put your best foot forward and make a solid first impression. Slow forms and distracting visuals achieve the opposite.</p>\n<p><strong>Particularly for participants that already have an idea, posting it should be easy and painless. The last thing you want to do is overwhelm people with overly complicated sections and irrelevant questions.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>On Eventornado, you can add on to your form as you go along, which means you only need the very basics to get started. The more you progress, the more opportunities participants have to add to their idea, tweak things, and polish things up.</p>\n<h3>4. People can&rsquo;t apply on mobile</h3>\n<p>Is the only option for people to apply to join your hackathon through desktop? If the answer&rsquo;s yes, you could be unknowingly deterring top-quality participants.</p>\n<p>On Eventornado, participants can create an account in just a few clicks, either using their social channels or through email.</p>\n<p>As a general rule, applying by mobile phone shouldn&rsquo;t take more than a couple of minutes&mdash;especially if you&rsquo;re only asking for the absolutely necessary details.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Applying to join your hackathon should be fun, quick and most of all&mdash;easy.</p>\n<h3>5. Your forms look generic</h3>\n<p>Nothing deters quality applicants faster than an un-branded ghost form.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Think of an application form as a companion to your business, and you can actually use it as a marketing tool!</p>\n<p>Take a quick look at your forms and ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is it easy to identify the form with the organisation? (this could be a hackathon banner on top of your form)</li>\n<li>Can visitors find more information about the event and organisation?</li>\n<li>Is it responsive?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A great form will answer YES to all of the above.</p>\n<h3>6. You ghost applicants once they&rsquo;ve applied</h3>\n<p>Once applicants hit that &lsquo;apply&rsquo; button on your form, what happens next?</p>\n<p>What does the signup page look like? Do applicants receive a welcome (or at the very least, acknowledgement) message? Do you send reminders in anticipation of the event?</p>\n<p><strong>Never leave applicants hanging after they&rsquo;ve signed up. Not only does it send a bad message, but you could also be sabotaging your hackathon&rsquo;s reputation.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>And if the hackathon date is some time away, the worst-case scenario is that you slip off the applicant&rsquo;s radar altogether and they don&rsquo;t show up. Send the follow-up message. Ask applicants to share your social post. Share a countdown and remind them of the hackathon the day before it begins.</p>\n<p>On Eventornado, we know that smart communication is one of the most important elements of running a great hackathon.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s why as soon as someone signs up to a hackathon hosted on Eventornado, they&rsquo;re automatically directed to a dedicated chat space, where all participants can meet each other and the organisers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a great way for everyone to start mingling straight away, break the ice, and more importantly, start brainstorming ideas. It&rsquo;s how organisers are able to keep up high-level engagement right until the event starts.</p>\n<h3>7. You&rsquo;re not promoting your hackathon</h3>\n<p>Remember when we said building the hackathon is only half the battle? Well, consider <em>promoting your hackathon</em> to be the other half.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s not enough to announce your hackathon on your website and then move along to the next task. If you want to reach more people and attract bright minds, it&rsquo;s absolutely vital that people receive your enthusiasm and excitement for the hackathon.</strong></p>\n<p>Create a buzz around your hackathon with mini-campaigns leading up to the day. There are a few ways you can do this. Here are a few ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Publish countdown messages on your social channels leading up to the countdown (think a week in advance) and then add this to a newsletter if you have one</li>\n<li>Share stories of previous winners (if this isn&rsquo;t the first hackathon), with photos and social tags. This is a great incentive for previous winners to share your post on their own channels as they proudly reflect on their achievements</li>\n<li>Share judge panel bios on your social channels, and don&rsquo;t forget to tag everyone&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Reach out to relevant publications and ask if they would be interested in sharing your hackathon announcement with their audience</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Take your submission process to the next level with Eventornado&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>You know the saying, <em>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s not just about the destination, but it&rsquo;s how you get there that matters&rdquo; </em>- who knew it was totally secretly talking about hackathons?</p>\n<p><strong>You create the opportunity for a great or terrible reputation from the moment you open applications to your next hackathon. And at every stage of the process, there&rsquo;s a window to win over quality applicants.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Eventornado helps hackathon organisers put their best foot forward so not only are they confident in bringing in great talent, but their reputation is getting a boost&mdash;all while generating buzz for the event.</p>\n<p>What does your application process look like? <a href=\"{{ route(\'request-demo\') }}\">Get in touch with us or request a free demo</a> of the platform to get in on the action.

You can <a href=\"https://theglobalhack.com/results\">read about the event and its winners here.</a></p>\n<p>The team at Eventornado are proud to have then partnered with founders of<em> Hack The Crisis Estonia</em>, providing them with the right infrastructure to host the hackathon that sparked a global movement.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the winners and where they are in their journeys, seven months since the 48-hour event.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.getzelos.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zelos</a>: Connecting volunteers with vulnerable members of society</h3>\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"https://eventornado-files.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/zelos.png\" alt=\"Zelos\">\n    </figure>\n<p>Estonian startup Zelos made the winners list of <em>Hack The Crisis Estonia</em> with an app which was initially developed to rethink volunteer team coordination.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Almost 7 months since the hackathon, the team found themselves amidst possibilities they never expected and a new direction for their prototype.</p>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic presented the team with a rare opportunity to rethink an app designed to streamline task delegation for event and festival managers, into a prototype to make a difference in the community.</p>\n<p>The app, Zelos Community Helpline, now <a href=\"https://e-estonia.com/zelos-rethinking-volunteer-team-coordination-during-covid-19/\" target=\"_blank\">connects volunteers with vulnerable people in their community </a>in need of a helping hand. After achieving a winning entry in March&rsquo;s <em>Hack The Crisis</em>, the Estonian startup placed in the Top 10 Empowerment and Solidarity track in April&rsquo;s The Global Hack, now even seeing opportunities to collaborate with various nation&rsquo;s governments.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://garage48.org/blog/hack-the-crisis-from-an-idea-to-an-execution-in-just-6-hours\" target=\"_blank\">Ventit Breathing Apparatus</a>: Taking the strain off healthcare workers&nbsp;</h3>\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"https://eventornado-files.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/ventit.png\" alt=\"Ventit Breathing Apparatus\">\n    </figure>\n<p>1% of those diagnosed with coronavirus develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and need a breathing machine (ventilator) to survive.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In a crisis as global as the coronavirus pandemic, many hospitals found that there simply <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/business/coronavirus-ventilator-shortage.html\" target=\"_blank\">weren&rsquo;t enough ventilators to go round</a> and the results were extremely distressing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>In the worst-case scenario, in Italy (where the virus spread so drastically, making it the first place outside Wuhan to issue a national lockdown), doctors were having to choose who lives and who dies, based entirely on the ventilators available.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Ventit Breathing Apparatus hacked a solution to make sure doctors never have to make such a distressing decision again. &ldquo;The apparatus adjusts existing resuscitation masks to provide a quick alternative to the machines&rdquo;, says Garage48, one of the founders of <em>Hack The Crisis Estonia.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>Perhaps the most impressing part of what the Estonian startup achieved is that &ldquo;<em>the system is designed in such a way that any engineer can take the blueprints and provide these machines to the hospitals near them&rdquo; - Laur L&auml;&auml;nemets</em></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.garage48.org/blog/fighting-the-covid-19-pandemic-with-the-power-of-community\" target=\"_blank\">Vanemuine</a>: A smarter way to call volunteers to the front line</h3>\n<p>Throughout the pandemic, over-flowing hospital rooms and limited resources called for medical volunteers to donate their time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The problem was that there was no efficient way to do this, based on the volunteer\'s skills, competence and location&mdash;a time-consuming and nonsecure database seemed like the only feasible way to do that.</p>\n<p><strong>Vanemuine stepped in and built Estonia&rsquo;s first medical volunteer management platform where volunteers can sign up, outline their skills, availability and location.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Crisis leaders are then able to locate medical volunteers from within the platform and send out a call to action, which the volunteers can accept or reject. Those managing the crisis can see a clear overview of the volunteers that have joined the front line and the details of their service using a simple method that doesn&rsquo;t overwhelm.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.hackthecrisisfinland.com/getinspired\" target=\"_blank\">Share ForceOne</a></h3>\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"https://eventornado-files.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/shareforceone.jpg\" alt=\"Share ForceOne\">\n    </figure>\n<p>If there&rsquo;s one area of society the coronavirus turned upside down, it&rsquo;s the workforce.</p>\n<p>A large number of companies and employees were plunged into completely unfamiliar territory, with not much room to get out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Share ForceOne is a B2B platform for companies in need of a workforce and companies whose workforce don&rsquo;t have any job opportunities left&rdquo;, says Lauri Sokk, Head Organiser of the project.</p>\n<p>The platform has been making it easy for companies to share their workforce.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>A company representative fills out one of two applications on the website, whether they have extra employees, or if they&rsquo;re in need of them.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Based on that, Share ForceOne matches the companies with each other and even provides the necessary contract templates and other bits and pieces they might need in order to get started.</p>\n<p>Share ForceOne is an intuitive and smart solution to the workforce crisis, and it&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.startupday.ee/news/share-force-one\" target=\"_blank\">continuing to be useful since it placed as a winner</a> in March&rsquo;s hackathon.</p>\n<p>Even after the state of emergency passes and the workplace begins to recover, this sort of needs-based solution could last for years, as companies slowly return to their pre-pandemic profit margins and employee numbers.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.velmio.com/corona-tracker\" target=\"_blank\">Corona-Tracker by Velmio</a>: preventing health disasters at the touch of a button</h3>\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"https://eventornado-files.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/velmio.png\" alt=\"Corona-Tracker by Velmio\">\n    </figure>\n<p>One of the most strenuous aspects of the virus has been on the healthcare systems&mdash;and before Estonia&rsquo;s Hack The Crisis, there was no secure way for the public and government to monitor the rapidly moving situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Velmio created Corona-Tracker, a data-driven app to help people monitor the COVID-19 outbreak, whether in perfect health, infected with the virus, or recovered.</strong></p>\n<p>Corona-tracker has been <a href=\"https://www.velmio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">helping users to analyse their symptoms to estimate a COVID-19 risk level</a>, and it also shows the risk level or nearby locations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Users simply log their symptoms, location and risk factors on the secure app, and the data will be made available to researchers to help them in their fight against the virus.</p>\n<p><strong>The app even runs passively in the background, detecting potential health issues and collecting insights to suggest lifestyle changes for the user.</strong></p>\n<p>Corona-tracker has been featured in CNN and Forbes and is growing rapidly as an advocate for preventative medicine.</p>\n<h3>Hack The Crisis Estonia: A nation of hacking, exploring and learning</h3>\n<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing <em>Hack The Crisis Estonia</em> has taught us, it&rsquo;s that there&rsquo;s immense power in being part of a community.</p>\n<p>When a crisis hits, people often look to the government for help and guidance. And while Hack The Crisis was backed by the UN and the European Commission, the hackathon was a noteworthy display of what innovation really means.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s much to learn from a country that lives and breathes the startup mindset, and we can&rsquo;t wait to witness and cheer on the success of the hackathon&rsquo;s winners from now and for years to come.</p>"
